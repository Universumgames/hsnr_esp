/*
this is an example config
if you've cloned this project and no config.hpp exists, rename this file and change the settings for your need
if you constribute to this project and you don't have a config.hpp copy this file and rename it to "config.hpp" instead of just renaming this file, so the example_config.hhpp wont't be lost
